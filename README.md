# **Sheridan College(Davis) Network Design and Implementation**

---

## **Abstract**

This project report presents the design and implementation of a computer networking model for Sheridan College's Davis Campus. The model connects all wings of the campus using routers, multilayer switches, normal switches, DHCP, DNS, VLANs, and Wi-Fi. Additionally, the campus-wide Wi-Fi is integrated with an ISP (Internet Service Provider) to ensure reliable internet connectivity.
